## About

Sparked by a game of bingo played at my brother-in-law's bachelor party and the inability to find a good, competitive, party-centered bingo app online.

Enter: Bayngo. Named wwith a combination of my sister's name and, you guessed it, "bingo!"

Users can create a new Bayngo Board or join an existing one using a simple and unique room code.

As users update their boards with completed tasks, all other users in a room will see their changes in real time.

## Getting Started

Setup your `.env.local` file with Pusher configuration

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
